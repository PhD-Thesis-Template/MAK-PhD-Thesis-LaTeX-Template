I would like to express my deepest appreciation to my supervisors, Prof. Supervisor's Name, Dr. Co-supervisor's Name, and Mr. Third Supervisor's Name, whose expertise, understanding, and patience, added considerably to my graduate experience. I also thank them for their encouragement and insightful critiques of my research work.

Additionally, I wish to acknowledge the role of my family for their unwavering support and encouragement throughout my study and through the process of researching and writing this thesis. This accomplishment would not have been possible without them. Thank you.
